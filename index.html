        <p class="lead mb-4">n this essay, I will be discussing the topic: American speculative fiction is consumed because it allows audiences to re-view and rethink the real world they live in. will be discussing the social issues that were reflected in the movie, Black panther[SS3] , such as what the movie represents, how does African American struggle with cultural identity and how Black Panther reflects on the current African American community. Through this example, I hope to bring out the point that American speculative fiction is indeed consumed because it allows audiences to re-view and rethink the real world they live in rather than just for the purpose of expanding imagination[SS4] . 
 
Sensing through speculative fiction
 
        	Prior to 1986 , no human beings could imagine what it would be like to be inside an automobile until Carl Benz created the first car in human history; in 1903, the Wright brothers invented the very first plane so that people can finally travel in the sky. Before these inventions happen, our ancestors never had the imaginations of what today’s world would be like as science becomes the dominant of the world. Nowadays, as we consume speculative fictions, whether we pay for a movie ticket or purchase a fictional novel, we are allowing these fictions to expand our imaginations of how the future world can be like. However, is there deeper purpose/use of speculative fiction? Personally,[SS6]  the answer is certainly a yes. While many might only consume speculative fictions to expand their imaginations, in my opinion, American speculative fiction is consumed because it allows audiences to re-view and rethink the real world they live in. [SS7] 
 
-Context of Black Panther
 
        	In 2018, Marvel released its 18th movie, Black Panther, describing a civil war in a third world African country named Wakanda. The story begins with the history of Wakanda. Wakanda has one of the most powerful resources in the world: vibranium. To keep this valuable weapon/resource away from the European colonizers, the King of Wakanda, T’Challa, decides to hide Wakanda in Africa as a poor third world country. However, on the other hand, T’Challa’s cousin, Killmonger, has the dream to use vibranium as a weapon to liberate and free all people of his kind. The two kings fight against each other for their own beliefs. As T’Challa loses the crown to Killmonger, T’Challa also finds out that his father murdered his uncle for the safety of Wakanda. T’Challa was angry, however, the story ends as he follows his father’s step and murders his own cousin Killmonger. 
 
-What does Black Panther represent? 
 
        	Despite the great action scenes and storyline of the Black Panther, the movie itself has a big representation for the African American communities and is described as “the most significantly positive black cultural impact worldwide since the 2008 election of President Barack Obama” by Kalenda Eaton in the written article, Eternal Blackness. Each main character in the movie is a symbol. T’Challa, the king of Wakanda, who was raised in a utopia, both African culture and technologies melted together, shows total loyalty and love towards his people. T’Challa (representing the elite class of African Americans[SS8] ) is the symbol of African American pride, the pride that is so precious and honored because of their culture. Described by Todd Steven Burroughs as “a recuperative figure and majestic signifier of the best of the Black anticolonialist movement” T'Challa is also a symbol of African American leaders. On the other hand, Killmonger (representing the struggling class of African Americans), the cousin of T’Challa, who was raised in Oakland and the military[SS9] , shows total disloyalty and hatred towards the society he came from. The constant oppression from the America society “taught him only violence and how it might make things right, a very real lesson that every Black American and other folks of color get on a daily basis”. (Black Panther: The Marvel film's meaning runs deep, by Cliff Cawthon[SS10] ) Killmonger is a symbol of the lives of most African Americans in the United States: pressured and racially profiled constantly. In the movie, Wakanda, the country of T’challa, is seen as a third world country that is poor and undeveloped by the rest of the world. However, in reality, Wakanda is the most developed country, as well as the “fairy tale version of Africa” as described by Adolph Reed in the written article, The Trouble with Uplift How black politics succumbed to the siren song of the racial voice. Wakanda is a place where African culture gets completely recognized and celebrated for, the origin of African American culture.
